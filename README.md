# Nonlinear-models-ML
Simple student project to test non-linear models on 2D synthetic data.

1. For the purposes of this task, synthetic two-dimensional data (x1 and x2) were generated. The number of samples has been set to 1000.

2. The equation of the non-linear function was derived from the trigonometric functions of the sum and difference of the angles. Then noise generated by rnorm() was added to the function.

3. The next stage of the task was to divide the previously prepared data into two subsets: training (75% of the base dataset) and test (25% of the base dataset).

4. Three models were selected to perform the task: Random Forest, XGBoost and SVM.

5. In order to collect data on the basis of which it was possible to compare models and decide which one is more accurate, the following calculations were made:
    - mean absolute errors
    - mean square errors
   
   Thanks to this, it was possible to later decide which models achieve the smallest prediction errors.
